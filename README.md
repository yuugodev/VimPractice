This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Vim practice

This project is fully edited in VIM. You can see the final output [here](https://vim.yuugo.dev).

Although I'm having a very hard time 'cause it's my first time using this editor, there are a couple of things I want to know that was very easy from my attempts from another editors:

- Copy and Paste
- Easily navigate from multiple files
- Search words
- Select all text (ctrl+a)
- Select multiple lines
- Handling typing errors fast

## My experience at moment

So far, I learned how to:

- Learned how to enter in INSERT mode
- basic commands like delete words, move to start, move to the last line, copy line, paste copied text after cursor.
- Save, exit and navigate on file explorer
